<span>This work presents the result of the analysis of the behavior of the digital currency Bitcoin, based on the evolution of the last five years. The analyzed database was made publicly available on the coindesk website, has a total record of 2611 data from October 2013 to the current date, December 12, 2020. This database was used to create a neural network that can predict Bitcoin digital currency's price based on information from the past; for this, we use LSTM - Long short-term memory, a recurring artificial neural network. The results obtained were evaluated using the average percentage error algorithm that generated positive results in the Bitcoin forecast.</span>
